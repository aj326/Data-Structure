This directory contains third party libraries used by jContractor.
jContractor uses:

Package:   The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL)
Web site:  http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/index.html
Version:   BCEL 5.0 Release Candidate 1
Notes:     We're actually using a slightly modified version of RC1.
           The build on Apache's download page has a serious bug in
           org.apache.util.ClassQueue.  The bug is fixed in the BCEL
           CVS repository.  jContractor's BCEL also does not include
           org.apache.bcel.verifier.exc.AssertionViolatedException
           because this class doesn't work with JDK 1.4 (due to a name
           clash).

Package:   werken.opt
Web site:  http://code.werken.com/xpath/
Version:   0.9.1 beta
